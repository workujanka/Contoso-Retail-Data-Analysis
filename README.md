Contoso Retail Sales Analysis: Trends, Segmentation, and Best-Sellers 

📊 1. Customer Segmentation by Total Purchase 

🔍 Insights: 

Gender-based spending shows that Males (M) slightly outspend Females (S) across most categories. 

Top categories by total sales: 

Home Appliances: Males ($173M), Females ($150M) 

TV and Video: Males ($127M), Females ($109M) 

Cameras and Camcorders: Males ($123M), Females ($107M) 

💡 Analysis:

Female customers show strong purchasing power, especially in categories like Computers and Cell Phones, where the gap is narrower. 

This segmentation can guide targeted marketing campaigns by gender and product type. 

📈 2. Product Category Sales by Year 

🔍 Insights: 

Home Appliances consistently lead in sales across all years (2007–2009), peaking in 2008. 

Cameras and Camcorders had a sharp decline from 2007 ($1.09B) to 2009 ($636M). 

Computers grew steadily, peaking in 2009 ($939M). 

TV and Video and Cell Phones remained stable with slight growth. 

💡 Analysis: 

Home Appliances are the most resilient category, showing consistent demand. 

Cameras and Camcorders may be losing relevance — possibly due to smartphones replacing standalone cameras.
